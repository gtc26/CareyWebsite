          <p>A Monochrome Life is an upcoming video game being created by Grant
            Carey as a personal project. It will serve as both a puzzle game and
            social awareness expirement. The game has been completely grayscaled
            to place colorblind players on the same difficulty as those who are
            able to see color. The game will go throughout the various tasks of
            an average life, but without the advantage of solving with colors.
            Due to still being in development, there is no link.</p>

          <p>Tree Hopper is a video game created by Grant Carey for the 2020 Game
            Development course at Illinois State University. It started with the
            idea of a simple parkour game. It went on to implement enemies, an outdoors
            feel, and buttons that trigger the remainder of the level. There is
            potential for the game to be completed depending on interest. A video
            can be viewed by clicking the image to the left.</p>
